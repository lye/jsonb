## jsonb

Collection of helper structs/methods for working with jsonb contained within PostgreSQL databases. Provides mutators which buffer changes to do persist data as partial updates using built-in jsonb operations. Has a crap schema declaration language to ensure that mutations don't break assumptions.

And stuff.
